Sample ActiveX control that outputs a QR code. Can be used in Access to generate QR codes, or as
a simple starting point for an ActiveX control.

Remember to replace the certificate provided with your own, and build while running Visual Studio 
as Administrator so that the control is registered. Access needs a restart after a rebuild.
